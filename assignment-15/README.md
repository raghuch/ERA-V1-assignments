This is the solution to Assignment-15, basic transformer architecture following the paper. We use it for English to Italian machine translation using the opus books dataset (from huggingface).
To Run the English - Italian  MT training, go to train.ipynb and just run the cells.

The current assignment shows the training process, and runs for 10 epochs. The aim is to get a train loss less than 4 (which is achieved -- see train.ipynb)
